## ✋ [Servo Movement with Hand Gesture](https://github.com/Adarsh-OPP/Servo_move_with-_hand_gesture)
Control a servo motor using hand gesture recognition via webcam.
- 🖐️ Uses MediaPipe for real-time hand tracking
- 🔄 Converts finger positions to servo angles
- 🔧 Serial communication with Arduino
- 🎯 Precise gesture-to-motion mapping

## 🔊 [Computer Vision Volume Control](https://github.com/Adarsh-OPP/ComputerVisionVolumeControl)
Adjust system audio volume using your hand's distance between fingers.
- ✋ Detects hand landmarks using OpenCV + MediaPipe
- 📏 Maps finger distance to volume level
- 🎛️ Controls system audio using `pycaw`
- ⚡ Real-time responsiveness and clean UI overlay

## 🔴 [Red Color Detector Using Webcam](https://github.com/Adarsh-OPP/Red_Color_Ditector_using_web_camp)
A beginner-friendly color detection system using HSV filtering.
- 🧪 Detects red objects in real-time
- 📷 Webcam + OpenCV-based detection
- 📏 Calculates contour area and draws bounding boxes
- 🧠 Basis for object tracking or triggering hardware actions
